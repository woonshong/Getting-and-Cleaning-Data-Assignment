2. Open the run_analysis.R file in your Rstudio. 
	- The Rstudio used to create this script is Version 0.99.465
	- The Rstudio runs on a 64bit Windows 8.1 Machine running R version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18)
	
3. When the "run_analysis.R" file is run, it will automatically set the working directory to where the file is located.
	- The source file should exist in the folder where the Raw data "UCI HAR Dataset" is present
	- The script will automatically clear all data and variables in memory when it starts

4. Running source(`run_analysis.R`) will generate a new file `tidy_data.txt` in the working directory.
